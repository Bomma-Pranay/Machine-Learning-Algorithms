    "k-Nearest Neighbors is one of the easiest Machine Learning algorithms. It is a “Classification” algorithm to be specific. But due to its generic procedure, it can be also used for feature selection, outlier detection(Wilson editing), and missing value imputations. It is also called Instance-Based Learning and Lazy Learning because at training time it does nothing! In the kNN, the hyper-parameter is “k”."

    "Let me illustrate kNN with a simple example. Let us assume that our data set has 3 class labels( A, B, C). Let us fix the value of k as 3 i.e we find 3 nearest neighbors. Now when a test point comes in, we find the 3 nearest neighbors in our data set. Let us assume that our algorithm gave us the 3 nearest neighbors as A, A, C. Since, the test point must belong to only one class, we have to select only one out of A, A, C. We introduce a voting mechanism now since A’s are 2 and C’s are 1. “A” wins the game and we assign the test point belongs to the class label “A”. It is as simple as that!\n",
